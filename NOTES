Update Zeroconf example (Gethin's fixes)

More info on MDPs - see below.







byzantine 
	- one quantitative minimum reachability probability
	- no parameters (models named N_K where N number of processes and K (maximum) number of corrupted processes
	- models very large and very little numerical computation (numerical computation is basically 1/2*1/2+1/2*1/2)
consensus
	- being sorted
courteous philosophers
	- without fairness only works for three phils and out notion of fairness too strong
	 (good for testing LTL?)
csma
	- added to prism-examples
	- includes
         qualitative and quantitative probabilistic reachability
         expected reachability
         (no deadline properties)
	- all properties should be symmetric and hence allow symmetry reduction to be employed
dining cryptographers
	- not a good model so ignore?
firewire
	- in prism-examples two versions (abst and impl)
	- qualitative reachability
	- expected reachability (two maximum but could consider minimum)
	- deadline property
	- parameters
		fast - probability of waiting short time
		delay - wire length (can vary between 3 and 36 as specified in the standard)
gossip
	- complicated so ignore?
ipv4
	- added to prism-examples
leader election (asynchronous)
	- in prism-examples
	- added pp file and reduced to a single pctl file through labels
	- ***** need to update webpage accordingly *****
	- qualitative reachability
	- quantitiave expected reachability
	- bounded reachability
mla examples
	- need to write proper versions of these using Puterman's book
mutual
	- already in prism examples
	- could remove loops to calculate expected time for a process to enter critical section
	- similarly to the courteous dining phils removing loops is not enough to show the desired
      liveness property (still need fairness)
	- again could use LTL for this?
phil
	- in prism-examples
	- qualititative for original and no-fair versions
	- have quantitative properties for nofair version (both bounded reach and expected time)
phil_lss
	- in prism examples
	- both qualitative and quantitative properties (bounded reach and expected reach)
	- need to check through but ato files etc present
pin blocking 
	- need to look at this see if anything can be done
rabin
	- two versions in prism examples
	- new version without fairness (by removing loops)
	- have quantititaive properties after removing loops
	- needs sorting and webpage updated
	- and just have the new version (delete old version?)
self-stabilisation
	- ij and beauquier both in prism examples
	- qualitative reachability
	- quantitative bounded until and expected reachability
wlan
	- added to prism-examples include
		qualitative reachability
		quantitative probabilistic/expected reachability
		dealdine (time bounded) properties
virus
	- used in ambient paper
	- webpage/add to prism-examples?
